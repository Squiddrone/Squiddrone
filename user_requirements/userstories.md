# Squiddrone Project user stories

## Description

In order for Squiddrone to reach its maturity state, going from Alpha, to Beta and to v1.0.0, the project will need:

-   For its specifications to be 100% complete.
-   Compliance tests for the specification.
-   The implementations to be 100% complete and spec compliant.

## user stories v1.0.0

Here you will find a comprehensive list of the various user stories in the Squiddrone Project to reach version 1.0.0.

### Role::user
#### UST001
-   [ ] As a user, I want to be able to communicate to the Drone, to set the target parameters for the flight trajectory.
    -   [ ] As a user, I want to use a computer, to communicate to the drone.
    -   [ ] As a user, I want to use a PC, to communicate to the drone.
    -   [ ] As a user, I want to use a linux, to communicate to the drone.
    -   [ ] As a user, I want to use an android app, to communicate to the drone.
#### UST002
-   [ ] As a user, I would like the drone to remain in position if I do not specify anything else, so that I do not have to adjust it myself.
#### UST003
-   [ ] As a user, I want to be able to let the drones fly as a swarm so that I can form patterns with them.
    -   [ ] As a user, I want to specify the color of the drone's LEDs so that I can use them to create patterns.
    -   [ ] As a user, I want several drones to regulate themselves as a swarm so that there are no collisions.
#### UST004
-   [ ] As a user, I would like to use a computer program to create a pattern for the drones so that I don't have to control the drones myself.
    -   [ ] As a user, I want to generate the data for a pattern from an image so that I don't have to do it myself.
#### UST005
-   [ ] As a user, I want to see the state of charge of the battery using the RGB LED when I switch on the drone, to see how long the drone can approximately fly.
#### UST006
-   [ ] As a user, I want the drone to have a minimum flight time of 15 minutes so that I can fly multiple patterns.
#### UST007
-   [ ] As a user, I want the drone to land safely on its own before the battery is completely depleted so that the drone is not damaged.
