# Squiddrone1

Squiddrone is a project for an autonomous flying swarm of drones.

## Description

### v1.0.0
In the first release an autonomous flying drone is planned, which can be controlled via a PC/Linux program and an optional Android app. The drone should regulate itself and maintain its position if it does not receive any further commands. The drone should be equipped with an RGB LED. It should be possible to couple several drones together to form a swarm of drones. The swarm of drones should be able to manage itself and automatically prevent collisions. By the PC/Linux program and/or the Android App patterns are to be given, which the drones will follow. It should also be possible to generate a pattern from an image.

### v2.0.0
In a further release, the drone is to be supplemented by an optional, further PCB. This board is intended for a machine vision application, so that the drone can be used to take pictures. The system should also be able to function as a swarm of drones, so that large areas can be covered by image technology. This system could be used, for example, in disaster control, reconnaissance or similar applications.
